# Roact Navigation

This project is currently based of [React Navigation](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/tree/4.x) version 4.

## Guide

The 'Getting Started' page from React Navigation documentation site is not really relevant to the Roblox environment, but any following pages contains information, examples and best practices that can all be applied to our version of the library. That is why the project itself does not contain as much documentation: our version should be so similar that examples can be trivially translated from React Navigation.

However, there are still deviations which you can learn more about on the [deviation page](deviations.md). This project aims to have as little deviation as possible, but sometimes it is best to deviate for different reasons. If you find anything missing there, let us know! It could be a deviation we should document better or one that we should resolve.
